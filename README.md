AnomalyGuard: Predictive Maintenance Anomaly Detection

AnomalyGuard is a Python-based tool for performing anomaly detection in industrial equipment data, with a focus on predictive maintenance applications. It leverages the Isolation Forest algorithm to identify anomalies (outliers) in sensor data, helping to prevent equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules.

Features

Anomaly Detection: Utilizes the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in sensor data, which can indicate potential equipment failures or malfunctions.
Predictive Maintenance: Helps organizations implement predictive maintenance strategies by identifying anomalies early and enabling proactive maintenance actions.
Scalable: Designed to handle large volumes of sensor data from industrial equipment, making it suitable for real-world applications.
Easy to Use: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for loading data, preprocessing, training the anomaly detection model, and making predictions.
Customizable: Allows users to customize preprocessing steps and model hyperparameters to suit their specific use cases and data requirements.
Usage
Data Preparation: Prepare your dataset containing sensor readings from industrial equipment. Ensure that the dataset is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV) and includes relevant features.
Data Loading: Load the dataset into the AnomalyGuard tool using the provided functions or utilities.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data as needed, including handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Model Training: Train the anomaly detection model using the Isolation Forest algorithm on the preprocessed data.
Anomaly Detection: Use the trained model to detect anomalies in new data samples or streaming data from industrial equipment.
Maintenance Planning: Incorporate the detected anomalies into your maintenance planning process to schedule proactive maintenance actions and minimize equipment downtime.
